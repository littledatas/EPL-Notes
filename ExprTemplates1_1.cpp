/* critiques:
 * 1) OK, the += operator is horribly innefficient. Note that by dispatching to the 
 * operator+ function we have to create a temporary (the local variable "result" in
 * the operator+ function). That temporary is contructed, assigned to, returned, and then
 * stupidly read from during the assignment operator.
 *   Construction of result: allocate space potentially assign all elements to zero
 *   Assignment to result: perform N adds, 2N reads and N writes
 *   Returning result and binding result to operator= rhs: free (returned by reference, passed by reference)
 *   operator=: perform N reads and N writes to copy lhs[k] = rhs[k] 
 *   Destructor for result (performed after op= returns): deallocate memory
 * We could trivially have written the += function to perform only 2N reads and N writes
 * with no allocations
 *
 * The duplicated code between operator+ and operator- is annoying. In fact, I had an error 
 * in my first version where I declared result using the {} syntax:
 *     valarray<T> result{size};
 * which doesn't work when T is an int, because {size} looks like a initializer_list<int>
 * because I'd duplicated the code, I had to fix this same stupid bug twice.
